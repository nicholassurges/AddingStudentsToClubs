# AddingStudentsToClubs

Adding Students to Clubs

First, create an application that added student names to a single club. As you recall, this was accomplished by copying each studentâ€™s name from a list box containing all available students to a list box containing the names of the club members.

For this assignment, add a ComboBox control containing the names of four different clubs. When the user selects a club name from this combo box, the Club Membership list box must show only the members of the selected club. When the user adds new members to the club, the membership list for that club must be kept in an array or list so that it can be recalled if the user should select the club name at a later time. Any student may join multiple clubs, but a club cannot contain duplicate names. (We will assume that all student names in our sample data are unique.)

Figure 8-51 shows the user interface for this new application. The user has selected the Honors club from the combo box, so the list box on the right side of the form displays the members of the Honors Club. The user can add new members or remove members. In Figure 8-52, the user has selected a different club (Computer), so the list of members is different. If the user were to select the Honors club again, the same list of members shown earlier in Figure 8-51 would appear.
